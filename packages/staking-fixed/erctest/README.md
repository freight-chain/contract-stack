### How to start local tests

Clone this repository and run `npm install`  
Then run fakenet lachesis node with rpc turned on:

```bash
./build/lachesis --fakenet=1/1 --rpc --rpcapi="eth,debug,admin,web3,personal,net,txpool,ftm,sfc"
```

Now you can run local tests with:

```bash
node testing.js
```

If a host/port of your rpc is not default, you can specify it with flags `-h` and `-p` respectively:

```bash
node testing.js -h "127.0.0.1" -p 18545
```

You can also set a contract address manualy with `-c` flag  
If you run lachesis with a single validator, you will probably also need to increase default stake value in code (for testing purpose).  
You can find it inside go-lachesis/cmd/lachesis/fake.go. For example:

```golang
vaccs = genesis.FakeValidators(validatorsNum, utils.ToFtm(1e10), utils.ToFtm(3175000 * 10))
```

You can also reduce cfg.MaxEpochBlocks value, this will speed testing up (variable is placed inside /go-lachesis/lachesis/config.go file,
FakeNetDagConfig func). For example you can set it to 20 blocks.

```golang
cfg.MaxEpochBlocks = 20
```

### How to start staging testing

A staging testing cases run via RPC calls, so you have to make sure that "--rpc" flag is passed to an app and that all namespaces are turned
on (you can just use an example above with --rpc --rpcapi="eth,debug,admin,web3,personal,net,txpool,ftm,sfc" flags).  
If rpc is turned on and nodes are running, it is possible to start testing.  
To run tests properly, you will have to provide a payer - an account with a huge amount of available resources. A payer should be defined
inside config.json. You can try to use a default config.json with a default payer for a staging testing, as it doesn't change realy often.
To run tests with a payer you just have to provide "--payer" flag, and a payer info will be taken from config.

```bash
node testing.js --payer
```
