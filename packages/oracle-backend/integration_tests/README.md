### Integration tests

This integration test launches a fake node for lachisis, creates accounts for oracle backend applications, deploys an oracle contract,
launches test source data to update prices, launches 3 instances of oracle backend applications, and after that the tests themselves are
launched.

##### Run steps

1. Build lachesis docker image:
   ```bash
    cd <your go-lachesis directory>/docker
    make lachesis
   ```
2. Change parameters in the file [./\_params.sh](_params.sh)`.
3. Run tests

```bash
  make integration-test
```

If the tests were not completed, run the script to stop [./down_test.sh](down_test.sh).

To add new cases use:

```js
IntegrationTests.testCases.addCase("<name>", function () {});
```
